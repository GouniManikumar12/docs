You decide how much to spend and how fast to spend it.

## Budget Types

- **Total Budget** – The maximum amount your campaign will spend overall
- **Daily Limit** – Optional cap to control day-to-day pacing
- **Pacing Mode** – "Run fast" or "Distribute evenly" through the day

You can pause, adjust, or increase budgets anytime.
AdMesh automatically stops delivery when your cap is reached.

## What Happens When Budget Runs Low

As your budget depletes, AdMesh uses **Surge Mode** to optimize delivery:

- When remaining budget is less than your CPA amount, surge mode activates automatically
- Your offer continues to be shown instead of pausing completely
- CPX and CPC rates increase 3x to reflect the limited budget window
- CPA tracking is temporarily disabled

This ensures your offer gets maximum visibility even with limited remaining budget.
