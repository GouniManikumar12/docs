# Budgets & Pacing

You decide how much to spend and how fast to spend it.

## Budget Types

- **Total Budget** – The maximum amount your campaign will spend overall  
- **Daily Limit** – Optional cap to control day-to-day pacing  
- **Pacing Mode** – "Run fast" or "Distribute evenly" through the day  

You can pause, adjust, or increase budgets anytime.  
AdMesh automatically stops delivery when your cap is reached.
