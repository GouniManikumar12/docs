## Account & Verification

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How long does brand verification take?">
    Brand verification typically takes 24 hours. We review your brand profile, website, and documentation to ensure legitimacy. Verification is faster if your website clearly describes your business and includes contact information.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I have multiple advertiser accounts?">
    Yes, you can create multiple accounts for different brands or business units. Each account requires separate brand verification. Contact support if you need to link accounts for consolidated reporting.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if my brand verification is rejected?">
    If rejected, you'll receive an email explaining why. Common reasons include incomplete business information or unclear brand identity. Update your profile and resubmit. Contact support@useadmesh.com if you need assistance.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I change my brand name after verification?">
    Yes, you can update your brand profile anytime. If you're changing your legal business name, you may need to re-verify. Contact support for guidance.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Offers & Management

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is an 'offer' in AdMesh?">
    An offer is how you connect your product or service to AI conversations. Each offer represents a specific product, service tier, or campaign. You can create multiple offers for different products or audience segments.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How many offers can I create?">
    There's no limit on the number of offers you can create. Many advertisers run different offers for different products, pricing tiers, or campaigns.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I edit my offer after publishing?">
    Yes! You can edit your offer description, categories, landing page URL, and call-to-action anytime. Changes take effect within minutes. Budget and payout strategy can also be adjusted.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What makes a good offer description?">
    Good descriptions are benefit-focused, specific, and concise (2-3 sentences). Lead with the benefit, not features. Example: "Project management tool that helps remote teams stay organized and ship faster" instead of "SaaS platform with advanced features."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I choose the right categories for my offer?">
    Choose 2-3 specific categories that match your product. Think like your customer: what would they search for? What problem are they solving? Avoid generic categories — "CRM Software" is better than "Business Tools."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the difference between CPX, CPC, and CPA?">
    **CPX (Cost Per Exposure):** You pay when your offer is shown ($0.01–$0.10). Best for brand awareness.  
    **CPC (Cost Per Click):** You pay when someone clicks your link ($0.50–$5.00). Best for traffic.  
    **CPA (Cost Per Action):** You pay when someone converts ($10–$100+). Best for ROI.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Pricing & Payout Strategy

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Which pricing tier should I choose?">
    Start with **CPC** if you're new to AdMesh. It balances visibility with engagement and gives clear ROI metrics. Move to CPA once you have conversion tracking set up and understand your unit economics.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I change my pricing tier after launching?">
    Yes! You can switch between CPX, CPC, and CPA anytime. Changes take effect within minutes. This is useful for testing different strategies or optimizing based on performance.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are typical CPX rates?">
    Typical CPX rates vary by industry:  
    - **SaaS:** $0.01–$0.10 per exposure  
    - **E-commerce:** $0.005–$0.05 per exposure  
    - **Services:** $0.02–$0.20 per exposure  
    Rates depend on your Contextual Relevance Score (CRS) and market demand.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How is my CPC rate determined?">
    You set your own CPC rate based on your business model and customer value. Typical ranges:  
    - **SaaS:** $0.50–$5.00 per click  
    - **E-commerce:** $0.10–$2.00 per click  
    - **Services:** $1.00–$10.00 per click  
    Higher rates may reduce volume but attract more qualified traffic.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's a good CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)?">
    A healthy CAC:LTV ratio is 1:3 or better. For example, if your customer lifetime value is $300, aim for a CAC under $100. Calculate: Total spend ÷ Conversions = CAC.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Budget & Spend

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I set my budget?">
    Set a daily budget (e.g., $50/day) in your dashboard. AdMesh paces your budget throughout the day. You can also set a monthly cap for predictable spending. Adjust anytime.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens when I run out of budget?">
    Your campaigns pause once your budget is exhausted. No more charges occur. You can add more budget anytime to resume spending.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I pause my campaigns?">
    Yes! You can pause campaigns instantly from your dashboard to stop spending. Resume anytime. This is useful for testing, optimizing, or managing budget.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How often is my spend updated?">
    Your dashboard updates hourly with current spend. You can see real-time metrics for exposures, clicks, and conversions. Detailed transaction history is available for download.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I set different budgets for different offers?">
    Yes! Each offer has its own budget. You can allocate your total budget across multiple offers based on performance and priorities.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Performance & Metrics

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What metrics should I track?">
    Key metrics depend on your pricing tier:  
    - **CPX:** Exposures, unique users, exposure rate  
    - **CPC:** Clicks, click-through rate (CTR), cost per click  
    - **CPA:** Conversions, conversion rate (CVR), cost per conversion  
    Always track ROI: Revenue ÷ Total spend.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's a healthy click-through rate (CTR)?">
    Healthy CTR varies by industry, but typical ranges are 3–8%. If your CTR is low, improve your offer description and categories. Higher CTR indicates better relevance.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I improve my Contextual Relevance Score (CRS)?">
    CRS (0–100) measures how well your offer matches user intent. Improve it by:  
    - Writing clear, benefit-focused descriptions  
    - Selecting specific, relevant categories  
    - Using honest pricing and value propositions  
    - Testing different offers and CTAs  
    Higher CRS = more visibility and better placement.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How long until I see results?">
    Most advertisers see their first exposures within hours of going live. Meaningful performance data (clicks, conversions) typically appears within 24–48 hours. Give campaigns at least 1–2 weeks before optimizing.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why isn't my offer getting impressions?">
    Check your Contextual Relevance Score (CRS). If it's low, improve your offer description and categories. Also verify:  
    - Your offer is published and active  
    - Your budget is sufficient  
    - Your categories match user queries  
    - Your landing page is working
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Billing & Invoicing

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How am I billed?">
    Charges accumulate as exposures, clicks, or conversions occur (depending on your pricing tier). Your account is updated hourly. You receive an invoice at month-end with Net 30 payment terms (due within 30 days).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What payment methods do you accept?">
    We accept:  
    - Credit card (automatic monthly billing)  
    - Bank transfer (for larger accounts)  
    - ACH (US-based accounts)  
    Contact support to set up your preferred payment method.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I get an invoice for my records?">
    Yes! Invoices are automatically generated at month-end and available in your dashboard. You can download and export them for accounting purposes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if I dispute a charge?">
    Contact support@useadmesh.com with details about the disputed charge. We'll review your account activity and transaction history to investigate. Most disputes are resolved within 5 business days.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Surge Mode

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is Surge Mode?">
    Surge Mode is an automatic optimization feature that keeps your offers visible when budget runs low. Instead of stopping delivery, AdMesh adjusts pricing (3x multiplier) to maximize remaining budget efficiency.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="When does Surge Mode activate?">
    Surge Mode activates automatically when your remaining budget is less than your CPA amount but greater than zero. For example, if your CPA is $10 and you have $8 remaining, Surge Mode activates.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does Surge Mode cost me more?">
    Yes, the 3x multiplier means higher CPX and CPC rates. However, Surge Mode allows continued delivery instead of pausing, which may provide better overall value depending on your goals.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I avoid Surge Mode?">
    Monitor your remaining budget regularly and add funds before reaching low-budget thresholds. Set daily limits to prevent rapid budget depletion. Adjust pacing to spread budget more gradually.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Will I lose conversion data in Surge Mode?">
    Conversion tracking is disabled during Surge Mode, so you won't see CPA metrics. However, all click and exposure data continues to be tracked normally.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Conversion Tracking

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I set up conversion tracking for CPA campaigns?">
    AdMesh provides conversion tracking pixels and webhooks. Add the pixel to your conversion page (thank you page, order confirmation, etc.). For webhooks, configure your backend to send conversion events to AdMesh.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What counts as a conversion?">
    A conversion is any desired action you define: signup, purchase, trial start, form submission, etc. You configure what counts as a conversion in your offer settings.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I track multiple conversion types?">
    Yes! You can track different conversion types (e.g., free trial vs. paid purchase) and assign different values to each. This helps optimize for your most valuable actions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How long does it take for conversions to appear in my dashboard?">
    Conversions typically appear in your dashboard within 1–2 hours of occurring. Real-time tracking is available via webhooks for your backend systems.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Optimization & Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How often should I review my campaign performance?">
    Review performance weekly to identify trends and optimization opportunities. Check CTR, CVR, and ROI. Pause underperformers and scale winners.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Should I test different offer descriptions?">
    Absolutely! Create variations of your offer and test different descriptions, categories, and CTAs. Scale winners and pause underperformers. A/B testing is key to optimization.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the best call-to-action (CTA)?">
    Action-oriented CTAs perform best: "Start free trial", "Buy now", "Learn more", "Sign up". Avoid vague CTAs like "Click here". Match your CTA to your goal.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I scale a high-performing offer?">
    Increase your daily budget gradually (10–20% increments). Monitor performance to ensure quality doesn't drop. If performance remains strong, continue scaling.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="When should I pause an offer?">
    Pause offers with low CTR/CVR, high CAC, or poor ROI. Give new offers at least 1–2 weeks before pausing. Sometimes offers need time to accumulate data.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
