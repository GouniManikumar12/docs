# Brand Safety & Fraud Policy

AdMesh continuously monitors all activity to maintain trust and transparency.

## Protected Against

- Automated or bot traffic  
- Fake or duplicate clicks  
- Misleading placements  
- Tampered links or redirects  

## Our Safeguards

- Cryptographically signed tracking links  
- Real-time traffic validation  
- Human review for suspicious activity  
- Automatic credit adjustments for invalid events  

Your campaigns are visible only in **verified, brand-safe AI environments** — never in unrelated or low-quality contexts.

> Every click, exposure, and conversion is verified before it reaches your invoice.
