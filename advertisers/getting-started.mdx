## Welcome to AdMesh

This guide walks you through setting up your advertiser account and launching your first offer. From account creation to your first live campaign, you'll be up and running in under 30 minutes.

---

## Step 1: Create Your Advertiser Account

### Sign Up
1. Visit [AdMesh Dashboard](https://useadmesh.com)
2. Click **"Sign Up as Advertiser"**
3. Enter your email and create a secure password
4. Verify your email address

### Complete Your Brand Profile
1. **Brand Name** — Your company or product name
2. **Website** — Your primary business website
3. **Industry** — Select your category (SaaS, E-commerce, Services, etc.)
4. **Description** — Brief overview of what you offer (2-3 sentences)

---

## Step 2: Verify Your Brand Identity

AdMesh requires brand verification to ensure trust and prevent fraud.

### What You'll Need
- **Business email** (matching your domain)
- **Company registration documents** (optional for verification)
- **Brand logo** (for display in AI conversations)

### Verification Process
1. Upload your brand logo (PNG/SVG, 500x500px recommended)
2. Confirm your business email
3. AdMesh team reviews your submission (typically within 24 hours)
4. Once approved, you're ready to create offers

> **Tip:** Verification is faster if your website clearly describes your business and includes contact information.

---

## Step 3: Understand "Offers"

An **offer** is how you connect your products or services to AI conversations. Each offer represents a specific product, service tier, or campaign.

### What Makes a Good Offer?

**Clear Product Description**
- Explain what your product does in simple terms
- Focus on benefits, not just features
- Example: "Project management tool for remote teams" (not "SaaS platform with API")

**Relevant Categories**
- Select 2-3 categories that match your product
- Be specific: "CRM for Small Teams" beats "Business Tools"
- Categories help AdMesh match your offer to user queries

**Honest Pricing & Value**
- Include your actual pricing or value proposition
- Example: "Free tier + $29/month Pro plan"
- Users trust transparent pricing

**Call-to-Action**
- What should users do? (Sign up, Try free, Learn more, Buy now)
- Make it clear and compelling

---

## Step 4: Create Your First Offer

### In the Dashboard
1. Click **"Create Offer"**
2. Fill in offer details:
   - **Product Name** — What you're advertising
   - **Description** — 2-3 sentences explaining the value
   - **Categories** — Select relevant tags
   - **Landing Page URL** — Where users will go when they click
   - **Call-to-Action** — What you want users to do

3. Set your **Payout Strategy** (see Step 5)
4. Review and publish

---

## Step 5: Choose Your Payout Strategy

AdMesh offers three flexible pricing tiers. Choose based on your goals:

### **CPX (Cost Per Exposure)**
- **Best for:** Brand awareness, product launches
- **You pay:** When your offer is shown to a user
- **Typical rate:** $0.01–$0.10 per exposure
- **Good if:** You want guaranteed visibility and brand building

### **CPC (Cost Per Click)**
- **Best for:** Driving traffic, testing demand
- **You pay:** When a user clicks your link
- **Typical rate:** $0.50–$5.00 per click
- **Good if:** You want to measure engagement and drive signups

### **CPA (Cost Per Action)**
- **Best for:** Performance-driven campaigns, maximizing ROI
- **You pay:** When a user completes your desired action (signup, purchase, trial)
- **Typical rate:** $10–$100+ per action
- **Good if:** You only want to pay for real conversions

### **Recommendation for First Campaign**
Start with **CPC** — it balances visibility with engagement and gives you clear ROI metrics without requiring conversion tracking setup.

---

## Step 6: Set Your Budget

### Daily Budget
- Set a daily spend limit (e.g., $50/day)
- AdMesh will pace your budget throughout the day
- You can adjust anytime from the dashboard

### Monthly Budget (Optional)
- Set a monthly cap for predictable spending
- Useful for planning and forecasting

### Budget Controls
- **Pause campaigns** anytime to stop spending
- **Adjust budgets** in real time based on performance
- **View spend** updated hourly in your dashboard

## Step 7: Go Live

Once your offer is created and budget is set:

1. Review your offer details one final time
2. Click **"Publish Offer"**
3. Your offer goes live within minutes
4. Start receiving exposures across AI platforms
