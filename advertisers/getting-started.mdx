# Getting Started as an Advertiser

Welcome to AdMesh! This guide will walk you through setting up your brand account and creating your first product offer.

## What is AdMesh?

AdMesh is an **AI-native advertising protocol** that enables your products to be recommended by AI agents (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, etc.) when users ask relevant questions.

**Example**: When a user asks "What's the best CRM for startups?", AI agents can recommend your product, and you only pay when users engage.

## Understanding Pricing

AdMesh uses a **three-stage attribution model** with fair, engagement-based pricing:

### Pricing Tiers

| Stage | What Happens | You Pay | Example Cost |
|-------|--------------|---------|--------------|
| **Exposure** | Product appears in AI response | CPX (if no click) | ~$0.08 |
| **Click** | User clicks your product link | CPC (if no conversion) | ~$0.50 |
| **Conversion** | User signs up/purchases | CPA (full value) | ~$10.00 |

### Key Principles

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Single Billing - Never Pay Twice">
    You **NEVER** pay twice for the same user. Higher engagement overrides lower charges.
    
    - If user converts → Pay **CPA only** (not CPC + CPA)
    - If user clicks but doesn't convert → Pay **CPC only**
    - If user sees but doesn't click → Pay **CPX only**
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Attribution Windows">
    - **Exposure → Click**: 30 minutes (or same session)
    - **Click → Conversion**: 24 hours
    - **Customizable**: Configure per your needs in Integration settings
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="CPX Calculation">
    CPX is calculated based on relevance:
    
    ```
    CPX = CPA × 0.001 × (Contextual Relevance Score / 100)
    ```
    
    **Example**: If CPA = $10 and CRS = 85%, then CPX = $0.085
