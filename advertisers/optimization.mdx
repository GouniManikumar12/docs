## Improving Contextual Relevance Score (CRS)

### 1. Write Detailed Product Descriptions

**Goal**: Increase semantic similarity (60% of CRS)

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="❌ Poor Description">
    ```
    Great CRM software. 
    Easy to use and affordable.
    ```
    
    **Issues**: Vague, no keywords, no specifics
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="✅ Good Description">
    ```
    HubSpot CRM is a free customer relationship 
    management platform for startups and small 
    businesses (1-50 employees). Features include 
    contact management, email tracking, pipeline 
    visualization, sales automation, and 500+ 
    integrations. Perfect for B2B SaaS companies 
    scaling their sales process.
    ```
    
    **Strengths**: Specific, keyword-rich, target audience
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**Best Practices**:
- ✅ Include 150-300 words
- ✅ Mention target audience (company size, industry)
- ✅ List key features and benefits
- ✅ Add use cases and scenarios
- ✅ Include technical specifications
- ✅ Use natural language (not keyword stuffing)

### 2. Choose Accurate Categories

**Goal**: Improve category matching (15% of CRS)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Be Specific">
    "CRM Software" > "Business Software" > "Software"
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Multiple Categories">
    Select 3-5 relevant categories per product
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Match User Language">
    Think about how users would categorize your product
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Avoid Over-categorization">
    Only add categories that truly apply
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Example - SaaS CRM**:
- ✅ CRM Software
- ✅ Sales Tools
- ✅ Customer Management
- ✅ B2B Software
- ✅ Startup Tools
- ❌ E-commerce (not relevant)
- ❌ Social Media (not relevant)

### 3. Add Relevant Keywords

**Goal**: Improve semantic matching and discoverability

**Keyword Types**:

| Type | Example | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Primary** | "CRM", "customer management" | Core product category |
| **Long-tail** | "free CRM for startups" | Specific user queries |
| **Synonyms** | "client database", "contact manager" | Alternative terms |
| **Use Cases** | "sales pipeline tracking" | Problem-solving queries |
| **Audience** | "startup CRM", "small business" | Target segment |

**Best Practices**:
- ✅ Add 10-20 keywords per product
- ✅ Use user language (not internal jargon)
- ✅ Include question-based keywords ("how to manage customers")
- ✅ Add competitor names (if allowed)
- ❌ Avoid keyword stuffing
- ❌ Don't use irrelevant keywords

### 4. Define Target Audience

**Goal**: Improve matching precision

**Be Specific About**:
- **Company Size**: "1-10 employees", "50-200 employees"
- **Industry**: "SaaS companies", "E-commerce brands", "Agencies"
- **Role**: "Sales teams", "Marketing managers", "Founders"
- **Use Case**: "Teams needing pipeline visibility"
- **Geography**: "US-based companies" (if applicable)

**Example**:
```
Target Audience: Startups and small businesses (1-50 employees) 
in B2B SaaS, looking for a free CRM to manage sales pipeline 
and customer relationships without upfront costs.
```

### 5. Set Competitive CPA

**Goal**: Improve payout score (15% of CRS)

**Strategy**:
1. **Research Competitors**: Check industry benchmarks
2. **Calculate LTV**: Ensure CPA < Customer Lifetime Value
3. **Start Higher**: Test with higher CPA, optimize down
4. **Monitor Performance**: Adjust based on conversion rate

**Example Calculation**:
```
Customer LTV: $500
Target ROI: 5x
Maximum CPA: $500 / 5 = $100
Starting CPA: $80 (conservative)
```

## Improving Click-Through Rate (CTR)

### 1. Optimize Offer Titles

**Goal**: Make titles compelling and clear

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="❌ Poor Titles">
    - "Our CRM Software"
    - "Product Recommendation"
    - "Check This Out"
    
    **Issues**: Generic, no value proposition, unclear
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="✅ Good Titles">
    - "Free CRM for Startups - HubSpot"
    - "Manage 1000+ Customers with Ease"
    - "CRM That Grows With Your Business"
    
    **Strengths**: Specific, value-driven, clear benefit
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

**Formula**: `[Benefit] + [Product] + [Differentiator]`

**Examples**:
- "Free CRM for Startups - No Credit Card Required"
- "AI-Powered Sales Pipeline - Close 30% More Deals"
- "All-in-One Customer Platform - Used by 10,000+ Teams"

### 2. Write Compelling Descriptions

**Goal**: Communicate value quickly

**Structure**:
1. **Hook**: Grab attention with main benefit
2. **Features**: List 2-3 key features
3. **Social Proof**: Add credibility (users, ratings, awards)
4. **CTA**: Clear next step

**Example**:
```
Manage your entire sales pipeline in one place. HubSpot CRM 
offers contact management, email tracking, and deal automation 
- completely free. Trusted by 100,000+ businesses worldwide. 
Start free today, no credit card required.
```

### 3. Highlight Rewards

**Goal**: Incentivize clicks with clear value

**Effective Reward Notes**:
- ✅ "$50 credit for new signups"
- ✅ "Get 3 months free (worth $150)"
- ✅ "20% off annual plans"
- ✅ "Free trial + $100 bonus credits"
- ❌ "Special offer available"
- ❌ "Discount for new users"

## Improving Conversion Rate (CVR)

| **Color** | Gray | High-contrast (blue, green) |
| **Size** | Small | Large, prominent |
| **Position** | Bottom only | Above fold + bottom |
| **Urgency** | None | "Start Free Today" |

### 3. Conversion Tracking Verification

**Ensure Tracking Works**:
<Steps>
  <Step title="Test Click Tracking">
    Click test link, verify redirect works
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test Conversion Pixel">
    Complete test conversion, check dashboard
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Monitor Attribution">
    Verify conversions appear within 24 hours
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Fix Issues Immediately">
    Broken tracking = lost revenue
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Budget Optimization

### 1. Start Small, Scale Winners

**Strategy**:
1. **Test Phase**: Allocate $50-$100 per offer
2. **Monitor**: Track CTR, CVR, CPA for 7 days
3. **Identify Winners**: Offers with ROI > 3x
4. **Scale**: Increase budget 2x for winners
5. **Pause Losers**: Stop offers with ROI < 1x

### 2. Budget Allocation Formula

```
Offer Budget = (Target Conversions × CPA) × 1.5
```

**Example**:
- Target: 10 conversions
- CPA: $10
- **Budget**: (10 × $10) × 1.5 = **$150**

The 1.5x multiplier accounts for clicks that don't convert.

### 3. Monitor Burn Rate

**Daily Spend Tracking**:
```
Days Remaining = Budget Remaining / Average Daily Spend
```

**Example**:
- Budget Remaining: $200
- Avg Daily Spend: $25
- **Days Remaining**: 8 days

**Action**: Refill budget before depletion to avoid pausing.
