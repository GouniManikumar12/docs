## The AI Economy Needs a New Ad Platform

Traditional advertising platforms were built for the web — banner ads, search keywords, and page views. But the AI economy is fundamentally different. Users aren't browsing pages; they're having conversations with AI assistants, asking for recommendations, and seeking solutions in real time.

**AdMesh is purpose-built for this shift.** Through autonomous Brand Agents, it connects your products to decision-ready audiences at the exact moment they're asking for help — inside AI conversations where intent is highest and relevance is everything.

## How AdMesh Differs from Traditional Platforms

| Aspect | Google Ads / Taboola | Affiliate Networks | **AdMesh** |
|--------|----------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Where ads appear** | Search results, web pages, feeds | Partner websites | Inside AI conversations via Brand Agents |
| **User intent** | Keyword-based or behavioral | Referral-based | Contextual conversation intent, evaluated autonomously by Brand Agents |
| **Pricing model** | CPM or CPC only | CPA only | CPX + CPC + CPA (flexible) |
| **Transparency** | Limited placement visibility | Black-box affiliate links | Real-time placement context |
| **Audience quality** | Broad, often low-intent | Variable quality | High-intent, decision-ready |
| **Conversion likelihood** | Lower (passive browsing) | Medium (referral-based) | **Higher (active seeking)** |

## AI-Native Placements: Brand Agents Meet User Intent

In AdMesh, your product doesn't appear as a banner or sidebar ad. Instead, your **Brand Agent responds autonomously inside an AI conversation** — when a user is actively asking for something your product solves. Your Brand Agent evaluates the context, determines relevance, and decides whether to participate in the auction.

### The Journey: Query → Exposure → Click → Conversion

**Example: A user asks Claude, "What's the best project management tool for remote teams?"**

1. **Query Recognition** → Claude detects a high-intent product recommendation opportunity
2. **Brand Agent Evaluation** → Your Brand Agent receives the context, evaluates relevance against your targeting rules and brand guidelines, and decides to bid
3. **Auction & Selection** → AdMesh runs an auction among eligible Brand Agents; your agent wins based on relevance and bid
4. **Exposure** → Your Brand Agent's response appears naturally in Claude's response (you pay CPX)
5. **User Engagement** → If the user clicks your link (you pay CPC)
6. **Conversion** → If the user signs up or purchases (you pay CPA)

**Result:** You only pay for verified visibility, engagement, and conversions — not wasted exposures.

## Brand Agent Onboarding Process

Creating your Brand Agent is a straightforward 5-step process that teaches your agent how to represent your brand:

### Step 1: Brand Story
Define your brand's identity and purpose:
- **Website URL** — We automatically extract brand information from your website
- **Brand Name** and **Business Categories** — Used for AI platform intent matching
- **Brand Summary** — Natural language description of your brand (50-1000 characters)
- **Target Customers** — Who you serve (1-10 customer segments)
- **Key Use Cases** — What problems you solve (1-10 use cases)
- **Optional details** — Company size, integrations, pricing models, brand voice, compliance notes

### Step 2: Product Story
Describe what you offer:
- **Product Details** — Name, description, key features, value propositions
- **Product URLs** and **Images** — Help your Brand Agent present your products accurately
- **Product Categories** — Used for relevance matching

You can add multiple products, each with its own details and characteristics.

### Step 3: Additional Information (Optional)
Add any extra context your Brand Agent should know:
- Custom key-value pairs for certifications, awards, partnerships, or other brand information
- Helps your Brand Agent provide more accurate and comprehensive responses

### Step 4: Agent Context Generation
We automatically generate a comprehensive AI agent context description (500-1000 words) that aggregates all information from Steps 1-3:
- Written in your brand's voice
- Optimized for AI agent understanding
- Ensures your Brand Agent knows when and how to represent you
- You can regenerate if needed

### Step 5: Agent Configuration
Configure your Brand Agent's behavior and budgets:
- **Pricing Limits** — Set maximum CPX, CPC, and CPA amounts
- **Budgets** — Daily and monthly spending limits with pacing modes
- **Targeting Rules** — Geographic, language, and regional targeting
- **Do-Not-Bid Controls** — Negative keywords, disallowed intents, and context patterns
- **Format & Behavior** — Choose allowed ad formats (tail, product, weave, bridge) and aggressiveness level

Once complete, your Brand Agent is ready to autonomously evaluate opportunities and represent your brand across AI platforms.
