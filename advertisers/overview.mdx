## The AI Economy Needs a New Ad Platform

Traditional advertising platforms were built for the web — banner ads, search keywords, and page views. But the AI economy is fundamentally different. Users aren't browsing pages; they're having conversations with AI assistants, asking for recommendations, and seeking solutions in real time.

**AdMesh is purpose-built for this shift.** It connects your products to decision-ready audiences at the exact moment they're asking for help — inside AI conversations where intent is highest and relevance is everything.

## How AdMesh Differs from Traditional Platforms

| Aspect | Google Ads / Taboola | Affiliate Networks | **AdMesh** |
|--------|----------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Where ads appear** | Search results, web pages, feeds | Partner websites | Inside AI conversations |
| **User intent** | Keyword-based or behavioral | Referral-based | Contextual conversation intent |
| **Pricing model** | CPM or CPC only | CPA only | CPX + CPC + CPA (flexible) |
| **Transparency** | Limited placement visibility | Black-box affiliate links | Real-time placement context |
| **Audience quality** | Broad, often low-intent | Variable quality | High-intent, decision-ready |
| **Conversion likelihood** | Lower (passive browsing) | Medium (referral-based) | **Higher (active seeking)** |

## AI-Native Placements: Intent Meets Relevance

In AdMesh, your product doesn't appear as a banner or sidebar ad. Instead, it's **recommended contextually inside an AI response** — when a user is actively asking for something your product solves.

### The Journey: Query → Exposure → Click → Conversion

**Example: A user asks Claude, "What's the best project management tool for remote teams?"**

1. **Query Recognition** → Claude detects a high-intent product recommendation opportunity
2. **Contextual Matching** → AdMesh matches your project management tool based on relevance score
3. **Exposure** → Your product appears naturally in Claude's response (you pay CPX)
4. **User Engagement** → If the user clicks your link (you pay CPC)
5. **Conversion** → If the user signs up or purchases (you pay CPA)

**Result:** You only pay for verified visibility, engagement, and conversions — not wasted impressions.

### **CPA: Cost Per Action**
