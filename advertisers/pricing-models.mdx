# Pricing Models: CPX vs CPC

AdMesh offers two distinct pricing models designed for different campaign objectives. Your brand-agent's AI automatically selects the optimal model based on context, but understanding each model helps you set the right expectations and optimize your campaigns.

---

## Overview: Two Models, One Goal

Both CPX and CPC models follow AdMesh's **single billing guarantee**: you're never charged twice for the same user engagement. The system automatically selects the highest-value engagement and charges only for that.

<Note>
  **Single Billing Guarantee**: If a user converts, you only pay CPA (not CPX or CPC). If they click but don't convert, you only pay CPC (not CPX). This prevents double-charging and ensures fair billing.
</Note>

## CPX Model: Awareness-Focused Pricing

### What is CPX Model?

The **CPX (Cost Per Exposure) Model** charges you when your product is shown to a user, regardless of whether they click. Clicks are tracked for analytics but don't incur additional charges.

### How It Works

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="1. Exposure (Recommendation Shown)">
    - **CPX is charged** when your product appears in an AI response
    - Amount: Based on contextual relevance score (typically $0.005–$0.50)
    - Timing: Charged after 30-minute attribution window if no click occurs
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="2. Click (User Clicks Link)">
    - Click is **tracked for analytics** (you see it in your dashboard)
    - **No CPC charge** — clicks are free in CPX model
    - CPX charge remains (already paid on exposure)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="3. Conversion (User Signs Up/Purchases)">
    - If conversion occurs, **CPA is charged** instead
    - CPX charge is **waived** (conversion is higher value)
    - Only CPA is charged
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Example Scenario

**User asks:** "What's the best CRM for small teams?"

```
T+0:    Your CRM appears in AI response → CPX charged ($0.05)
T+5min: User clicks your link → Tracked, no CPC charge
T+2hrs: User signs up → CPA charged ($10.00), CPX waived

Result: Only $10.00 charged (CPA)
```

### Best For

- ✅ **Brand awareness campaigns** — Maximize visibility
- ✅ **Predictable budgeting** — Know your exact cost per exposure
- ✅ **Low-risk testing** — Test new products or markets
- ✅ **Top-of-funnel marketing** — Build brand recognition

### Advantages

| Advantage | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Predictable Costs** | Fixed cost per exposure, no variable click charges |
| **No Click Risk** | Clicks don't increase your costs |
| **Analytics Included** | Click tracking provides insights without extra cost |
| **Lower Barrier** | Easier to justify spend for awareness goals |

---

## CPC Model: Performance-Focused Pricing

### What is CPC Model?

The **CPC (Cost Per Click) Model** reserves CPX budget on exposure but only charges when users click. If no click occurs, CPX is charged. If a click occurs, CPX is released and CPC is charged instead.

### How It Works

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="1. Exposure (Recommendation Shown)">
    - **CPX budget is reserved** (not charged yet)
    - Budget is held in pending state
    - If no click within 30 minutes, CPX is charged
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="2. Click (User Clicks Link)">
    - **CPX is released** (waived, returned to your budget)
    - **CPC is charged** instead (typically $0.10–$0.30)
    - You only pay for engagement, not just visibility
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="3. Conversion (User Signs Up/Purchases)">
    - If conversion occurs, **CPA is charged** instead
    - CPC charge is **waived** (conversion is higher value)
    - Only CPA is charged
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Example Scenario

**User asks:** "Best project management tool for remote teams?"

```
T+0:    Your tool appears → CPX reserved ($0.05, not charged)
T+5min: User clicks link → CPX released, CPC charged ($0.20)
T+2hrs: User signs up → CPA charged ($10.00), CPC waived

Result: Only $10.00 charged (CPA)
```

### Best For

- ✅ **Performance campaigns** — Focus on clicks and conversions
- ✅ **ROI optimization** — Pay only when users engage
- ✅ **Conversion-focused** — Maximize qualified traffic
- ✅ **Budget efficiency** — Reserve budget but only charge on engagement

### Advantages

| Advantage | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Pay for Engagement** | Only charged when users click |
| **Budget Protection** | CPX reserved but not wasted if click occurs |
| **Performance Tracking** | Clear correlation between spend and engagement |
| **Industry Standard** | Familiar CPC model with AI enhancements |

## How AdMesh Selects the Model

Your brand-agent's AI (unified reasoning layer) automatically selects the optimal pricing model based on:

- **Query context** — User intent and conversation flow
- **Campaign goals** — Awareness vs performance objectives
- **Budget availability** — Wallet balance and pricing model affordability
- **Market conditions** — Competitive landscape and relevance scores

The selected model is stored in the recommendation as `preferred_pricing_model` and determines billing behavior.

## Comparison with Industry Standards

### Traditional Advertising Models

| Model | When Charged | Industry Standard |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| **CPM** | Per 1,000 impressions | Charge on impression, clicks free |
| **CPC** | Per click | Charge only on click, no impression charge |
| **CPA** | Per conversion | Charge only on conversion, no click/impression charge |

### AdMesh Innovation

| Model | Exposure | Click | Conversion | Innovation |
|-------|----------|-------|------------|------------|
| **CPX Model** | ✅ Charged | ❌ Free (tracked) | ✅ Charged (waives CPX) | Awareness-focused, predictable costs |
| **CPC Model** | ⏸️ Reserved | ✅ Charged (releases CPX) | ✅ Charged (waives CPC) | Performance-focused, budget protection |

### Key Differences

1. **CPX Model ≠ Traditional CPM**
   - CPM: Charges per 1,000 impressions (volume-based)
   - CPX: Charges per verified exposure with intent (quality-based)
   - CPX: Tracks clicks for analytics (CPM typically doesn't)

2. **CPC Model ≠ Traditional CPC**
   - Traditional CPC: No exposure charge/reservation
   - AdMesh CPC: Reserves CPX on exposure, releases on click
   - Both: Charge on click, but AdMesh prevents double-billing

3. **Cascading Attribution**
   - Traditional: Separate billing for each event type
   - AdMesh: Automatic waiver/release of lower-value charges
   - Result: Single billing guarantee, never charged twice
