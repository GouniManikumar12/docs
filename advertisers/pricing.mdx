description: "Understand CPX, CPC, and CPA ,  the AdMesh performance model"
---

AdMesh uses a transparent, performance-based pricing model with three layers:

---

A small fee applies each time your product is **shown** to a verified user inside an AI conversation.  
Only viewable, valid impressions count ,  no hidden or off-screen placements.

> CPX ensures your brand earns measurable visibility for every real exposure.

---

You pay when a user **clicks** your AdMesh link and visits your site.  
Ideal for traffic and awareness campaigns.

> Every click also includes its minimal CPX exposure cost.

---

You pay only when a user completes a **conversion event** such as a signup or purchase.  
Perfect for ROI-focused advertisers.

> CPA combines with CPX + CPC to create a full-funnel, performance-based billing model.

---

Each layer represents a deeper level of engagement.  
You're billed only for verified actions at each stage.

| Stage | Event | Typical Rate | Example Units | Cost |
|--------|--------|---------------|----------------|------|
| Awareness | 1,000 Exposures (CPX) | $0.20 / 100 | 1,000 | $2.00 |
| Engagement | 100 Clicks (CPC) | $0.50 / click | 100 | $50.00 |
| Conversion | 10 Purchases (CPA) | $10 / action | 10 | $100.00 |
| **Total** |  |  |  | **$152.00** |

---

AI interactions happen in real-time conversations ,  every impression has value.  
CPX makes sure you see *where and how often* users were exposed to your offer, even before engagement.

- Verifies visibility and reach  
- Keeps campaign performance predictable  
- Rewards high-quality placement opportunities  

---

| Tier | You Pay For | Best For |
|------|--------------|-----------|
| **CPX** | Verified ad views | Visibility & reach |
| **CPC** | Valid user clicks | Traffic & awareness |
| **CPA** | Confirmed conversions | ROI & growth |

> All campaigns automatically include CPX tracking.  
> You control CPC / CPA rates, budgets, and pacing directly from your dashboard.

## Surge Mode Pricing

When your remaining budget is insufficient for a full CPA charge but greater than zero, AdMesh automatically activates **Surge Mode** to optimize delivery.

In Surge Mode:
- CPX and CPC rates increase 3x
- CPA tracking is temporarily disabled
- Your offer continues to be shown instead of pausing
- Partial billing charges only what's available

This ensures maximum visibility with your remaining budget.
