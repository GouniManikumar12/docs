# Earnings Model & Revenue Share

Learn how AdMesh pays AI platforms for displaying recommendations and driving user engagement.

---

## How You Earn

### Three Revenue Streams

You earn a share of what advertisers pay for each engagement level:

| Engagement | Advertiser Pays | You Earn (50%) | Example |
|------------|-----------------|----------------|---------|
| **Exposure** | CPX (~$0.008) | ~$0.004 | User sees recommendation |
| **Click** | CPC (~$0.50) | ~$0.25 | User clicks link |
| **Conversion** | CPA (~$10.00) | ~$5.00 | User signs up/purchases |

<Note>
  Default revenue share is **50%**. High-volume partners may negotiate custom splits.
</Note>

---

## Revenue Share Model

### Default Split: 50/50

```
Your Earnings = Total Engagement Value × 50%
```

**Example Calculation**:
- Advertiser pays CPA: $10.00
- AdMesh platform fee: $5.00 (50%)
- **Your earnings**: $5.00 (50%)

### Custom Revenue Shares

Available for partners with:
- **High Volume**: 10,000+ queries/month
- **High Quality**: Average CRS > 75
- **High Conversion**: CVR > 15%

**Potential Splits**:
- Standard: 50/50
- High Volume: 60/40 (you get 60%)
- Premium: 70/30 (you get 70%)

## Single Billing Principle

### You Earn for Highest Engagement Only

Just like advertisers only pay once, you only earn for the highest engagement level achieved.

**Billing Logic**:

### Example Scenarios

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Scenario 1: Full Conversion (Best Case)">
    **Timeline**:
    - 10:00 AM - Exposure (CPX: $0.008)
    - 10:05 AM - Click (CPC: $0.50)
    - 12:30 PM - Conversion (CPA: $10.00)
    
    **Advertiser Pays**: $10.00 (CPA only)
    **Your Earnings**: $10.00 × 50% = **$5.00**
    
    **Note**: You earn CPA share only, not CPX + CPC + CPA
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Scenario 2: Click Without Conversion">
    **Timeline**:
    - 10:00 AM - Exposure
    - 10:05 AM - Click
    - 24+ hours - No conversion
    
    **Advertiser Pays**: $0.50 (CPC only)
    **Your Earnings**: $0.50 × 50% = **$0.25**
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Scenario 3: Exposure Without Click">
    **Timeline**:
    - 10:00 AM - Exposure
    - 30+ minutes - No click
    
    **Advertiser Pays**: $0.008 (CPX only)
    **Your Earnings**: $0.008 × 50% = **$0.004**
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Earnings Calculation

### CPX Earnings

CPX is calculated based on Contextual Relevance Score:

```
CPX = CPA × 0.001 × (CRS / 100)
Your CPX Earnings = CPX × Revenue Share %
```

**Example**:
- CPA: $10.00 (1000 cents)
- CRS: 85.0
- CPX: 1000 × 0.001 × (85.0 / 100) = 0.85 cents
- **Your Earnings**: 0.85 × 50% = **0.425 cents ($0.00425)**

### CPC Earnings

CPC is a fixed amount set by the advertiser:

```
Your CPC Earnings = CPC × Revenue Share %
```

**Example**:
- CPC: $0.50
- **Your Earnings**: $0.50 × 50% = **$0.25**

### CPA Earnings

CPA is the full conversion value:

```
Your CPA Earnings = CPA × Revenue Share %
```

**Example**:
- CPA: $10.00
- **Your Earnings**: $10.00 × 50% = **$5.00**
