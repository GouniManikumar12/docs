---

The **Contextual Relevance Score (CRS)** is what sets AdMesh apart from traditional ad networks. It evaluates how naturally a product or service fits within a user’s question or conversation, ensuring that recommendations appear only when they truly belong.  

Instead of showing random ads, AdMesh uses CRS to deliver suggestions that feel timely, relevant, and meaningful in context.

## Why It Matters

In normal advertising, impressions are based on page views or keywords.  
In AdMesh, impressions happen inside AI conversations — where users are asking for help, ideas, or tools.

That’s why **relevance is everything**.

> CRS helps keep recommendations helpful, honest, and aligned with what the user is really looking for.

It protects user trust, improves click-through rates, and ensures advertisers pay for meaningful visibility, not noise.

## How We Measure Relevance

Every time a user asks a question, AdMesh reviews multiple factors before deciding what to show.  
The CRS (a score from 0 to 100) is based on:

- How closely your product matches the user’s query  
- How well your categories and description fit the topic  
- The overall clarity and completeness of your listing  
- How credible and trusted your brand appears on the network  
- How competitive your offer is compared to others in the same space  

> Higher CRS means your product feels more relevant — so it appears more often and in better positions.

## Score Levels

| Score Range | Quality | What It Means |
|--------------|----------|----------------|
| **90–100** | Excellent | Perfect match — shown first and most often |
| **75–89** | Good | Strong fit — regularly visible |
| **60–74** | Fair | Relevant — appears when space allows |
| **45–59** | Weak | Limited visibility — needs improvement |
| **0–44** | Poor | Not shown — not relevant enough |

**Tip:** Products scoring **75+** are considered high quality and perform best across the network.

- Higher CRS = more visibility and stronger results

- Better relevance means better performance, not higher waste  

For **platforms**  
- Higher CRS = more natural, helpful answers for users  
- Keeps recommendations useful, not intrusive  
- Improves user trust and engagement metrics

## How to Improve Your CRS

### 1. Be Clear and Descriptive
Write descriptions that explain exactly what your product does and who it’s for.  
Avoid buzzwords — focus on clarity and benefits.

### 2. Choose the Right Categories
Use accurate, specific categories instead of broad ones.  
Example: **“CRM Software for Small Teams”** is better than **“Business Tools.”**

### 3. Match User Language
Think like your users — write in their words.  
Use phrases like “tools to grow your small business” instead of “enterprise optimization platform.”

### 4. Keep It Honest
List only features and benefits that truly apply to your product.  
Transparent listings earn better CRS and trust scores.

### 5. Review and Update Regularly
Refresh your product info every few weeks to reflect updates, pricing changes, or new use cases.

## Tracking Your CRS

You can view your average CRS in the AdMesh dashboard.  
There, you’ll see:

- **Average CRS per product** — how well each listing matches user intent  
- **Query-level CRS** — where your offer performed best  
- **Trend over time** — how optimization improves your visibility  

Use these insights to fine-tune your listings and steadily raise your score.

---

## In Simple Terms

- **CRS** = How relevant your product is to what users are asking  
- **Higher CRS** = Better placement and stronger engagement  
- **Low CRS** = Missed opportunities — improve your descriptions or targeting  
- **Goal**: Stay above **75** for consistent, high-quality exposure  

> CRS is how AdMesh keeps advertising natural, useful, and trusted — built for AI conversations, not banner clicks.
