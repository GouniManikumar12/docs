title: "Contextual Relevance Score"
description: "Understanding how AdMesh measures recommendation quality and calculates CPX billing"
---

The **Contextual Relevance Score (CRS)** is a 0-100 metric that measures how well a product recommendation matches a user's query. It directly impacts CPX costs, recommendation ranking, and platform revenue.

---

## What is CRS?

CRS is AdMesh's **quality signal** — a machine-learned score that combines multiple signals to determine how relevant a product is to a user's specific query.

Higher CRS = Better match = Higher CPX cost, but also higher likelihood of clicks and conversions.

### How CRS is Calculated

CRS combines multiple weighted signals:

- **Semantic Similarity** (60%): How closely the product matches the query meaning using embeddings
- **Category Match** (15%): Whether product categories align with query intent
- **LLM Confidence** (5%): AI model's confidence in the match
- **Payout Score** (15%): Advertiser's CPA amount and competitiveness
- **Trust Scores** (5%): Product and brand credibility metrics

### Score Ranges

| Score Range | Quality | Meaning | Platform Action |
|-------------|---------|---------|-----------------|
| **90-100** | Excellent | Perfect match for user's query | Rank first, highest priority |
| **75-89** | Good | Strong relevance, likely to convert | Rank high, show prominently |
| **60-74** | Fair | Moderate relevance, may convert | Show, but lower priority |
| **45-59** | Poor | Weak relevance, unlikely to convert | Optional (filter out recommended) |
| **0-44** | Very Poor | Not recommended (filtered out) | Do not show |

**Recommendation**: Platforms should filter out scores below 60 to maintain user experience quality.

## How CRS Affects CPX

CRS is the **primary multiplier** for CPX costs. The higher the CRS, the higher your CPX — but also the higher your likelihood of clicks and conversions.

### CPX Formula (CPA Model)

For advertisers using **CPA-based payout**:

```
CPX = (CPA × 0.001) × (CRS / 100)
```

**Where**:
- **CPA**: Your cost per action (conversion) in dollars
- **CRS**: Contextual Relevance Score (0-100)
- **0.001**: Conversion factor to calculate exposure cost from action value

### CPX Formula (CPX Model)

For advertisers using **direct CPX pricing**:

```
CPX = Base CPX Rate × (CRS / 100)
```

### Real-World Examples

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="High CRS (90) - Excellent Match">
    **Scenario**: SaaS CRM perfectly matches "best CRM for startups"

    - CPA: $50.00
    - CRS: 90.0
    - **CPX = ($50 × 0.001) × (90 / 100) = $0.045 per exposure**

    **Interpretation**: You pay 4.5 cents per verified exposure. Higher cost, but much more likely to convert.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Medium CRS (70) - Good Match">
    **Scenario**: Project management tool for "team collaboration software"

    - CPA: $25.00
    - CRS: 70.0
    - **CPX = ($25 × 0.001) × (70 / 100) = $0.0175 per exposure**

    **Interpretation**: You pay 1.75 cents per exposure. Moderate cost, decent conversion potential.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Low CRS (50) - Weak Match">
    **Scenario**: Generic productivity tool for specific query

    - CPA: $10.00
    - CRS: 50.0
    - **CPX = ($10 × 0.001) × (50 / 100) = $0.005 per exposure**

    **Interpretation**: You pay 0.5 cents per exposure. Low cost, but unlikely to convert.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="CPX Model Example">
    **Scenario**: Direct CPX pricing model

    - Base CPX Rate: $0.20
    - CRS: 75.0
    - **CPX = $0.20 × (75 / 100) = $0.15 per exposure**

    **Interpretation**: You pay 15 cents per exposure with direct CPX model.

## Improving Your CRS

### 1. Optimize Product Descriptions

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Do's" icon="check">
    - Write detailed, keyword-rich descriptions
    - Include use cases and benefits
    - Mention target audience
    - Add technical specifications
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Don'ts" icon="x">
    - Generic marketing copy
    - Keyword stuffing
    - Vague descriptions
    - Missing key details
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**Example - Poor Description**:
```
Great CRM software for businesses. Easy to use and affordable.
```

**Example - Good Description**:
```
HubSpot CRM is a free customer relationship management platform designed 
for startups and small businesses. Features include contact management, 
email tracking, pipeline visualization, and sales automation. Integrates 
with Gmail, Outlook, and 500+ apps. Perfect for teams of 1-50 people 
looking to scale their sales process without upfront costs.
```

### 2. Choose Accurate Categories

Select categories that precisely match your product:

- ✅ **Specific**: "CRM Software" > "Business Software"
- ✅ **Multiple**: Add 3-5 relevant categories
- ✅ **Accurate**: Only categories that truly apply

### 3. Add Relevant Keywords

Include terms users would search for:

- ✅ **User Language**: "customer management" not "CRM solution"
- ✅ **Long-tail**: "free CRM for startups" not just "CRM"
- ✅ **Synonyms**: "client database", "contact manager", "sales tracker"

### 4. Define Target Audience

Be specific about who your product is for:

- ✅ **Company Size**: "Startups with 1-10 employees"
- ✅ **Industry**: "SaaS companies", "E-commerce brands"
- ✅ **Use Case**: "Sales teams needing pipeline visibility"

### 5. Set Competitive CPA

Higher CPA can improve CRS (15% weight):

- ✅ **Market Rate**: Research competitor CPAs
- ✅ **Value-based**: Price based on customer lifetime value
- ✅ **Test & Adjust**: Start higher, optimize over time

## Monitoring CRS

### Dashboard Analytics

Track CRS performance in your dashboard:

1. **Queries Page**: See CRS for each individual query
2. **Offer Analytics**: View average CRS per offer
3. **Product Performance**: Compare CRS across products

### Key Metrics to Watch

| Metric | What It Means | Action |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| **Average CRS** | Overall match quality | Aim for 70+ |
| **CRS Distribution** | Range of scores | Reduce low-scoring matches |
| **CRS vs CTR** | Correlation | Higher CRS should = higher CTR |
| **CRS vs CVR** | Conversion correlation | Optimize for high-CRS conversions |

---

## CRS in API Responses

### For AI Platforms

CRS is included in every recommendation:

```json
{
  "recommendations": [
    {
      "product_id": "abc-123",
      "title": "HubSpot CRM",
      "meta": {
        "contextual_relevance_score": 87.5,
        "reason": "Perfect match for startup CRM needs"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Best Practices**:
- Filter recommendations with CRS < 60
- Rank by CRS (highest first)
- Display CRS to users as quality indicator

### For Advertisers

View CRS in dashboard queries:

- **Individual Queries**: See exact CRS for each exposure
- **Aggregate Stats**: Average CRS per offer/product
- **Trends**: Track CRS changes over time

---

## CRS vs Other Metrics

### CRS vs Trust Score

| Metric | What It Measures | Impact |
|--------|------------------|--------|
| **CRS** | Query-product match quality | CPX cost, ranking |
| **Trust Score** | Brand/product credibility | User confidence, CTR |

Both are important, but serve different purposes.

### CRS vs Click-Through Rate

- **High CRS + High CTR**: Excellent performance ✅
- **High CRS + Low CTR**: Poor ad copy or positioning ⚠️
- **Low CRS + High CTR**: Misleading recommendations ❌
- **Low CRS + Low CTR**: Poor match, optimize or pause ❌
