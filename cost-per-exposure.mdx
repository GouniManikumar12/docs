title: "Cost Per Exposure (CPX)"
description: "Understand how AdMesh calculates exposure-based pricing for AI conversations"
---

**Cost Per Exposure (CPX)** is the visibility layer of the **AdMesh AI-native ad network**, designed specifically for conversational and AI environments.

It measures **real, verified visibility** every time your product is displayed to a user who is *actively seeking something related* to what you offer.

---

## CPX vs CPM: Why a New Metric Was Needed

| Traditional CPM (Cost per Mille) | AdMesh CPX (Cost per Exposure) |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Charges per 1,000 *page impressions* | Charges per *verified exposure* inside an AI response |
| Based on banner views or ad slots | Based on **user intent** and **query relevance** |
| Relies on cookies and viewability tags | Privacy-safe, **server-side** exposure validation |
| Optimized for websites and feeds | Optimized for **AI chats, search, and agents** |
| Measures *reach*, not *relevance* | Measures *visibility within context* |
| Often inflated by passive impressions | Fired only when **recommendations are actually shown** |

### Why CPM Doesn’t Work for AI Conversations

In traditional advertising, CPM measures how many people *saw* an ad ,  but in AI conversations, there is no “page load” or banner view.

Instead, **AdMesh tracks exposure when a recommendation appears contextually inside an answer** ,  a verified moment where the user is reading about something relevant.

**That’s why CPX exists:** it bridges the gap between *visibility* and *intent*, measuring the real value of exposure inside AI-driven user interactions.

> CPX = the new currency of visibility for conversational AI environments.

## How CPX Works

CPX represents the fee an advertiser pays when their offer is **shown to a verified user** in a chat, search, or AI response.  
Every CPX event is logged only when:
1. The recommendation is actually rendered in the UI, and  
2. The user session is verified as active and unique.

No cookies, no page tags ,  just verified, privacy-safe visibility.

---

## How CPX Is Determined

AdMesh calculates CPX dynamically for each exposure using three key inputs:

1. **Campaign Type**  
   - Direct CPX model → you define your base exposure rate.  
   - CPA model → AdMesh automatically derives a proportional exposure cost.

2. **Contextual Relevance Score (CRS)**  
   - A 0–100 score showing how closely your offer matches the user’s intent.  
   - Higher CRS = stronger match = higher CPX and higher visibility.

3. **Market Competitiveness**  
   - Reflects advertiser demand within your product category or query theme.  

> AdMesh’s proprietary pricing engine automatically adjusts CPX to ensure fairness, performance balance, and ROI optimization.

## CPX in Practice

### Example 1 ,  High-Relevance Match
| Attribute | Example |
|------------|----------|
| Model | CPA |
| Query | “best CRM for small teams” |
| CRS | 90 |
| Estimated CPX | Slightly higher |
| Outcome | High visibility + top placement |

### Example 2 ,  Moderate Match
| Attribute | Example |
|------------|----------|
| Model | CPA |
| Query | “tools to manage finances” |
| CRS | 70 |
| Estimated CPX | Medium |
| Outcome | Shown in contextually relevant conversations |

---

## CPX vs CPC vs CPA

| Metric | Trigger | Typical Range | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------------|----------|
| **CPX** | Offer is displayed | $0.005–$0.50 | Visibility & reach |
| **CPC** | User clicks | $0.10–$5.00 | Engagement |
| **CPA** | User converts | $5–$100+ | Performance |

> CPX captures attention, CPC measures engagement, and CPA proves value.

---

## What Affects CPX

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Contextual Relevance Score (CRS)** | Better match → higher CPX → higher placement priority |
| **Payout Model** | CPA campaigns auto-derive exposure rates |
| **Competition** | More demand = higher exposure value |
| **Creative Quality** | Clear, relevant product listings perform better |

---

## Optimizing for CPX

### 1. Improve Relevance (CRS)
- Use precise categories and descriptive keywords  
- Write conversational, user-focused product summaries  
- Ensure the landing page matches your offer promise  

### 2. Set Realistic CPX/CPA Rates
Higher rates increase visibility. For performance campaigns, set CPA based on your true customer value.

### 3. Monitor and Adjust
Use AdMesh’s dashboard to track:
- Average CPX per campaign  
- CPX vs click-through rate (CTR)  
- CPX vs conversion performance (CVR)
