## What is Cost Per Exposure (CPX)?

**Cost Per Exposure (CPX)** is the fee you pay when your product is shown to a verified user in an AI conversation or search result. It represents the baseline cost for visibility and reach.

CPX is calculated differently depending on your **payout model**:
- If you use **CPX model**: Direct CPX rate
- If you use **CPA model**: CPX is derived from your CPA amount

---

## CPX Calculation Formula

### For CPX-Based Offers

```
CPX = Base CPX Rate × Contextual Relevance Score (CRS) Multiplier
```

**Example**:
- Base CPX Rate: $0.10 per exposure
- CRS: 85 (good match)
- **CPX = $0.10 × (85/100) = $0.085 per exposure**

---

### For CPA-Based Offers

When you use a **CPA (Cost Per Action)** payout model, CPX is automatically calculated from your CPA:

```
CPX = (CPA × 0.001) × (CRS / 100)
```

**Where**:
- **CPA**: Your cost per action (conversion) in dollars
- **CRS**: Contextual Relevance Score (0-100)
- **0.001**: Conversion factor to calculate exposure cost from action value

---

## CPX Calculation Examples

### Example 1: CPA Model with High Relevance

**Scenario**: SaaS product with CPA model, perfect match for user query

- **CPA**: $50.00 (you pay $50 per signup)
- **CRS**: 90 (excellent match)
- **CPX = ($50 × 0.001) × (90 / 100)**
- **CPX = $0.05 × 0.90 = $0.045 per exposure**

**Interpretation**: You pay 4.5 cents for each verified exposure of your product.

---

### Example 2: CPA Model with Medium Relevance

**Scenario**: E-commerce product, moderate match for user query

- **CPA**: $25.00 (you pay $25 per purchase)
- **CRS**: 70 (good match)
- **CPX = ($25 × 0.001) × (70 / 100)**
- **CPX = $0.025 × 0.70 = $0.0175 per exposure**

**Interpretation**: You pay 1.75 cents for each verified exposure.

---

### Example 3: CPA Model with Low Relevance

**Scenario**: Generic product, weak match for user query

- **CPA**: $10.00 (you pay $10 per action)
- **CRS**: 50 (weak match)
- **CPX = ($10 × 0.001) × (50 / 100)**
- **CPX = $0.01 × 0.50 = $0.005 per exposure**

**Interpretation**: You pay 0.5 cents for each verified exposure.

---

### Example 4: CPX Model (Direct Rate)

**Scenario**: Direct CPX pricing model

- **Base CPX Rate**: $0.20 per exposure
- **CRS**: 75 (good match)
- **CPX = $0.20 × (75 / 100)**
- **CPX = $0.15 per exposure**

**Interpretation**: You pay 15 cents for each verified exposure.

---

## How CRS Affects CPX

The **Contextual Relevance Score (CRS)** is a multiplier that adjusts your CPX based on how well your product matches the user's query.

| CRS Range | Quality | CPX Multiplier | Impact |
|-----------|---------|----------------|--------|
| 90-100 | Excellent | 0.90-1.00 | Highest cost, best match |
| 75-89 | Good | 0.75-0.89 | Moderate cost, strong match |
| 60-74 | Fair | 0.60-0.74 | Lower cost, moderate match |
| 45-59 | Poor | 0.45-0.59 | Minimal cost, weak match |
| 0-44 | Very Poor | 0.00-0.44 | Filtered out (not shown) |

**Key Insight**: Higher CRS = Higher CPX, but also higher likelihood of clicks and conversions.

## CPX vs Other Metrics

### CPX vs CPC vs CPA

| Metric | When You Pay | Typical Cost | Best For |
|--------|--------------|--------------|----------|
| **CPX** | Product is shown | $0.005-$0.50 | Visibility & reach |
| **CPC** | User clicks link | $0.10-$5.00 | Traffic & awareness |
| **CPA** | User converts | $5.00-$100+ | ROI & growth |

**Billing Flow**:
1. User sees your product → **CPX charged**
2. User clicks your link → **CPC charged** (CPX waived if conversion happens)
3. User completes action → **CPA charged** (CPX + CPC waived)

---

## Factors That Affect Your CPX

### 1. Your Payout Model
- **CPA Model**: CPX derived from CPA amount
- **CPX Model**: Direct CPX rate you set

### 2. Contextual Relevance Score (CRS)
- Higher CRS = Higher CPX
- Improve CRS by optimizing product description, categories, and keywords

### 3. Product Quality
- Better product descriptions → Higher CRS → Higher CPX
- More specific categories → Better matching → Higher CRS

### 4. Advertiser Competitiveness
- Higher CPA/CPX rates → Better positioning
- More competitive offers → Higher visibility

---

## Optimizing Your CPX

### Strategy 1: Improve Product Matching

**Better CRS = Better ROI despite higher CPX**

- Write detailed product descriptions
- Add specific, relevant categories
- Include long-tail keywords
- Define clear target audience

**Result**: Higher CRS → Higher CPX → More qualified users → Better conversions

---

### Strategy 2: Adjust Your CPA

If using CPA model, your CPA directly affects CPX:

- **Higher CPA** → Higher CPX → Better positioning → More visibility
- **Lower CPA** → Lower CPX → Less visibility → Fewer exposures

**Recommendation**: Set CPA based on customer lifetime value, not just immediate profit.

---

### Strategy 3: Monitor CPX Performance

Track these metrics in your dashboard:

- **Average CPX**: Your typical exposure cost
- **CPX vs CTR**: Does higher CPX lead to more clicks?
- **CPX vs CVR**: Does higher CPX lead to more conversions?
- **CPX Trend**: Is your CPX increasing or decreasing over time?

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why does my CPX vary?">
    CPX varies based on CRS (Contextual Relevance Score). Each query produces a different CRS, so your CPX changes per exposure. Higher CRS = Higher CPX.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I set a minimum CPX?">
    No, CPX is calculated automatically based on your payout model and CRS. You can only control your CPA (if using CPA model) or base CPX rate (if using CPX model).
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Is CPX charged even if no one clicks?">
    Yes. CPX is charged when your product is shown to a verified user, regardless of whether they click. This ensures you pay for visibility.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How can I reduce my CPX?">
    CPX is calculated automatically. To reduce it, you can:
    1. Lower your CPA (if using CPA model)
    2. Improve product matching to maintain high CRS with lower CPA
    3. Focus on high-converting products
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What's a good CPX?">
    It depends on your business model. Generally:
    - **SaaS**: $0.01-$0.10 per exposure
    - **E-commerce**: $0.005-$0.05 per exposure
    - **Services**: $0.02-$0.20 per exposure
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
