## Why CPX Exists

**CPX (Cost Per Exposure)** was created because **CPM (Cost Per Mille)** doesn't work in AI conversations.

In traditional advertising, CPM measures how many people *saw* an ad. But in AI conversations, there is no "page load" or banner view. Instead, **AdMesh tracks exposure when a recommendation appears contextually inside an answer** — a verified moment where the user is reading about something relevant.

**That's why CPX exists:** it bridges the gap between *visibility* and *intent*, measuring the real value of exposure inside AI-driven user interactions.

> CPX = the new currency of visibility for conversational AI environments.

## The Problem with CPM

### REAL PROBLEM #1: CPM rewards volume, not quality

CPM charges you per 1,000 exposures, regardless of:
- Whether the user actually saw the ad
- Whether the user had any intent to buy
- Whether the ad was relevant to the user's current context

**Result:** You pay for low-value exposures that don't drive results.

### REAL PROBLEM #2: CPM doesn't measure real attention

CPM counts:
- Page loads (even if user never scrolled)
- Banner views (even if user ignored it)
- Feed exposures (even if user scrolled past)

**But it doesn't measure:**
- Whether the user actually read the ad
- Whether the ad was contextually relevant
- Whether the user had purchase intent

### REAL PROBLEM #3: CPM creates perverse incentives

Because CPM rewards volume, publishers optimize for:
- More page loads
- More "scroll depth" tracking
- More feed units

All because CPM rewards **volume**, not **quality**.

You pay $0.003 per impression — yes. But 60–80% of those exposures are **low-value**.

That's why CPA and CPC outperform CPM in many verticals.

---

### REAL PROBLEM #4: CPM is meaningless in AI environments

AI chats and agents don't have:
- pages
- feeds
- banners
- scroll depth
- viewable areas

So you can't use CPM because there's no "impression surface."

CPX fixes that by counting:

> "Did the AI *surface* the brand inside the answer in a meaningful, verifiable way?"

---

## The Intent Model: CPX

CPX (Cost per Exposure) measures verified, human-seen exposures tied to an explicit intent signal inside an agentic environment.

Each CPX event is:
- Signed by verifiers (platform + network)
- Linked to a serve_token
- Auditable end-to-end

Advertisers pay only for real, verified interactions — not assumptions.

---

## Why Create a New Metric?

Many advertisers ask: *why change?* CPM has worked for decades and is easy to understand.

But AI-driven discovery breaks the assumptions that made CPM valid.

In a conversational context:
- There are no "pages" or "exposures" to count.
- What matters is whether an AI system truly *exposed* a verified recommendation to a user with intent.
- CPX gives advertisers confidence that every dollar tracks to a verified, human exposure — not a background impression.

So CPX doesn't replace CPM out of novelty — it replaces it out of necessity.

---

## Corrected Explanation

**Simple Version:**

CPM charges advertisers for every impression — even if the impression had low attention, poor visibility, or no user intent. The price is prorated (for example, a $3 CPM means $0.003 per impression), but the problem is **what gets counted as an impression**, not the math.

In AI conversations, there are no pages or banners, so CPM does not make sense. CPX measures **verified exposures inside conversations**, which is a more accurate and intent-aligned unit.

## Comparison Table

| Aspect | CPM (Traditional) | CPX (AdMesh) |
|--------|-------------------|--------------|
| **What it measures** | Per 1,000 page exposures | Per verified exposure in AI response |
| **Based on** | Banner views or ad slots | User intent and query relevance |
| **Tracking method** | Cookies and viewability tags | Privacy-safe, server-side exposure validation |
| **Optimized for** | Websites and feeds | AI chats, search, and agents |
| **Measures** | Reach, not relevance | Visibility within context |
| **Inflation risk** | Often inflated by passive exposures | Fired only when recommendations are actually shown |
| **Intent alignment** | No | Yes — tied to user query |
| **Verification** | Assumed | Verified and signed |

## Key Differences

### 1. Measurement Unit

- **CPM**: Counts exposures (page loads, banner views)
- **CPX**: Counts verified exposures (AI recommendations shown with intent)

### 2. Context Awareness

- **CPM**: No context — same price whether user is browsing or actively seeking
- **CPX**: Context-aware — price scales with relevance to user's query

### 3. Verification

- **CPM**: Assumes impression occurred (may not have been seen)
- **CPX**: Verified exposure — confirmed that recommendation was shown

### 4. Intent Alignment

- **CPM**: No intent signal — user may have no interest
- **CPX**: Intent-aligned — user is actively asking for something related

### 5. Environment

- **CPM**: Designed for web pages and mobile apps
- **CPX**: Designed for AI conversations and agentic environments

## When to Use CPX vs CPM

### Use CPX When:

- ✅ Advertising in **AI conversations** (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, etc.)
- ✅ You want **intent-aligned** placements
- ✅ You need **verified exposures** (not assumed exposures)
- ✅ You value **contextual relevance** over volume
- ✅ You're targeting **decision-ready audiences**

### Use CPM When:

- ✅ Advertising on **traditional websites** (banner ads, display)
- ✅ You need **high-volume** reach
- ✅ You're running **awareness campaigns** (not conversion-focused)
- ✅ You have **simple measurement needs** (exposures only)
- ✅ You're advertising in **non-AI environments**

## Example: CPM vs CPX in Practice

### CPM Scenario (Traditional Web)

```
User visits website → Page loads → Banner ad shown
→ CPM charged ($0.003 per impression)
→ User may or may not have seen the ad
→ No intent signal — user was just browsing
```

**Result:** You pay for an impression that may not have been seen or relevant.

### CPX Scenario (AI Conversation)

```
User asks: "What's the best CRM for small teams?"
→ AI surfaces your CRM recommendation
→ CPX charged ($0.05 per exposure)
→ Verified exposure — user is actively seeking a CRM
→ High intent — user is decision-ready
```

**Result:** You pay for a verified, intent-aligned exposure to a qualified user.

---

## Summary

CPX doesn't replace CPM because it's "better" — it replaces it because **CPM doesn't work in AI environments**.

- **CPM** = Volume-based, impression counting for web pages
- **CPX** = Quality-based, verified exposure counting for AI conversations

Both have their place, but for AI-native advertising, **CPX is the only metric that makes sense**.
