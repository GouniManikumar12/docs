## Pricing & Costs

<AccordionGroup data-faq-section="Pricing & Costs">
  <Accordion title="What are the different pricing models?" data-faq-item="What are the different pricing models?">
    AdMesh offers three pricing models:

    **CPX (Cost Per Exposure)**
    - You pay when your offer is shown to a user
    - Best for: Brand awareness and reach
    - Typical cost: $0.01 - $0.10 per exposure

    **CPC (Cost Per Click)**
    - You pay when a user clicks on your offer
    - Best for: Driving traffic to your website
    - Typical cost: $0.10 - $1.00 per click

    **CPA (Cost Per Action)**
    - You pay only when a user completes a desired action (purchase, signup, etc.)
    - Best for: Performance-focused campaigns
    - Typical cost: $1.00 - $50.00+ per action

    For detailed pricing information, see [Pricing Models](/advertisers/pricing).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How is billing calculated?" data-faq-item="How is billing calculated?">
    Billing is calculated based on your selected pricing model:

    - **CPX Model**: Charged per exposure (impression)
    - **CPC Model**: Charged per click
    - **CPA Model**: Charged per conversion

    You're only charged for actual interactions. If your offer isn't shown or clicked, you don't pay.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the difference between CPX and CPA?" data-faq-item="What's the difference between CPX and CPA?">
    | Aspect | CPX | CPA |
    |--------|-----|-----|
    | **When you pay** | When offer is shown | When user completes action |
    | **Risk** | Higher (pay for impressions) | Lower (pay for results) |
    | **Best for** | Brand awareness | Performance/ROI focused |
    | **Cost control** | Budget-based | Results-based |
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I change my pricing model after creating an offer?" data-faq-item="Can I change my pricing model after creating an offer?">
    Yes, you can change your pricing model at any time. However, changing the model will reset your campaign statistics and budget allocation. We recommend finalizing your pricing model before launching.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Budget & Pacing

<AccordionGroup data-faq-section="Budget & Pacing">
  <Accordion title="How do I set up my budget?" data-faq-item="How do I set up my budget?">
    To set up your budget:

    1. Go to **Offers** → Select your offer
    2. Click **Budget Settings**
    3. Enter your **Total Budget** (total amount you want to spend)
    4. Choose your **Pacing Strategy**:
       - **Even Pacing**: Spread budget evenly over the campaign period
       - **Accelerated**: Spend budget as quickly as possible
       - **Custom**: Set specific daily limits

    5. Set your **Campaign Duration** (start and end dates)
    6. Save and confirm

    For more details, see [Budgets & Pacing](/advertisers/budgets-pacing).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens when I reach my budget limit?" data-faq-item="What happens when I reach my budget limit?">
    When your offer reaches its budget limit:

    - Your offer stops being shown to new users
    - Existing clicks/conversions in progress are still processed
    - You can increase your budget at any time to resume the campaign
    - Unused budget is not refunded
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is Surge Mode?" data-faq-item="What is Surge Mode?">
    Surge Mode is an automatic optimization feature that activates when your remaining budget is less than your CPA amount but greater than zero.

    In Surge Mode:
    - Your offer continues to be shown instead of pausing
    - CPX and CPC rates increase 3x to reflect limited budget
    - CPA tracking is temporarily disabled
    - You only pay for exposures and clicks

    This allows your offer to maximize visibility with remaining budget. To avoid Surge Mode, maintain sufficient budget for your CPA amount.

  <Accordion title="Can I pause my campaign?" data-faq-item="Can I pause my campaign?">

    3. Your offer will stop being shown immediately
    4. You can resume at any time

    Paused campaigns don't incur any charges.
  </Accordion>

    - Conversion event is properly configured
