## Welcome to AdMesh

**AdMesh** is the first **AI-native ad network** built on the **AdMesh Protocol**, a new infrastructure that connects AI chatbots, assistants, and search platforms with verified product recommendations in real time.

It enables developers and platforms to **monetize user intent** while helping advertisers **reach decision-ready audiences** through conversational placements — with privacy, transparency, and contextual accuracy at the core.

---

## SDK-First Integration

AdMesh provides **SDKs** that handle session management, caching, attribution, rendering, and transparency — so you can focus on building great experiences.

### Two Main SDKs

**1. `admesh-ui-sdk` (React Frontend)**  
- Zero-code integration for displaying recommendations  
- Handles rendering, tracking, and transparency labels  
- Supports multiple layouts: citation, product cards, and weave mode  
- Works with any React application  

**2. `@admesh/weave-node` (Node.js / Express Backend)**  
- Optional backend SDK for weaving recommendations into LLM responses  
- Includes database caching for instant retrieval  
- Simplifies backend integration for Node.js environments

## Why AdMesh Exists

Traditional ad systems (CPM/CPC) were never designed for AI.  
They rely on banners, cookies, and page views — not real-time conversations or generative responses.

AdMesh introduces a **three-tier performance model** built for the conversational web:

| Tier | Trigger | What It Measures |
|------|----------|------------------|
| **CPX** | Verified exposure | Visibility and reach |
| **CPC** | User click | Engagement and intent |
| **CPA** | Conversion | Proven performance |

Every campaign automatically tracks all three, giving brands better accuracy and platforms predictable revenue.
