---

## Welcome to AdMesh

**AdMesh** is the first **AI-native ad protocol** built for the new era of intelligent platforms.
It helps **AI chatbots, search assistants, and agents** generate revenue by embedding **context-aware product recommendations** directly inside conversations.

---

## What is AdMesh?

AdMesh is not a traditional ad network — it's a **monetization protocol for intent.**

Whenever a user asks a question like *"best project management tools"* or *"how to edit PDFs online"*,
AdMesh turns that **intent** into a **structured recommendation opportunity** — matching it with verified offers from advertisers.

### The Core Idea
AdMesh connects **platforms** (AI agents, chat apps, search tools) with **advertisers** through a unified intent-based marketplace:
- **AI platforms** earn revenue for showing relevant, context-aligned offers.
- **Advertisers** reach users at the moment of purchase intent — not random impressions.

---

## Why AdMesh Exists

Traditional ad models like CPM or CPC weren't designed for AI.
They rely on banners, cookies, and clicks — not conversations.

AdMesh solves this by introducing **CPA + CPC + CPX tiers** built specifically for:
- **Chat-based interfaces** (LLMs, assistants, agents)
- **Contextual recommendations** (embedded within answers)
- **Privacy-first experiences** (no tracking pixels or cookies)

---

## How It Works

```
User Query → Intent Detection → Product Matching → Recommendation → Revenue Event
```

1. The platform sends a user's query to AdMesh.
2. AdMesh's model detects **intent** and retrieves matching offers.
3. The platform displays those offers naturally within its response.
4. When users view, click, or convert — revenue is shared instantly.

### Revenue Layers

| Layer | Trigger | Who Benefits |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| **CPX** | Verified exposure (user sees the recommendation) | Platform |
| **CPC** | User clicks recommendation link | Platform & Advertiser |
| **CPA** | User completes a purchase or signup | Platform & Advertiser |

## Why It's Different

| Traditional Ads | AdMesh |
|-----------------|---------|

| Cookie-based tracking | Server-side attribution (no PII) |
| Distracting user experience | Integrated into the AI's natural response |

> AdMesh makes monetization invisible — users see helpful suggestions, not ads.
