## Welcome to AdMesh

**AdMesh** is an agentic advertising network built for AI-native interfaces.

As users shift from browsing and scrolling to asking questions and completing tasks inside AI conversations, traditional advertising models break down. Impression-based ads, keyword targeting, and manual campaign management are poorly suited for environments where intent is explicit, contextual, and dynamic.

AdMesh enables advertising to operate agent-to-agent, not banner-to-user.

Rather than pushing ads into interfaces, AdMesh allows brand agents to respond autonomously to real user intent surfaced by AI platforms, with pricing, relevance, and safety enforced in real time.

## SDK-First Integration

AdMesh provides **SDKs** handles attribution, rendering, and transparency — so you can focus on building great experiences.

### Two Main SDKs

**1. `admesh-ui-sdk` (React Frontend)**  
- Zero-code integration for displaying recommendations  
- Handles rendering, tracking, and transparency labels  
- Supports multiple layouts: tail, product cards, and weave mode  
- Works with any React application  

**2. `@admesh/weave-node` (Node.js / Express Backend)**  
- Optional backend SDK for weaving recommendations into LLM responses  
- Includes database caching for instant retrieval  
- Simplifies backend integration for Node.js environments

## Why AdMesh Exists

Traditional ad systems (CPM/CPC) were never designed for AI.  
They rely on banners, cookies, and page views — not real-time conversations or generative responses.

AdMesh introduces a **three-tier performance model** built for the conversational web:

| Tier | Trigger | What It Measures |
|------|----------|------------------|
| **CPX** | Verified exposure | Visibility and reach |
| **CPC** | User click | Engagement and intent |
| **CPA** | Conversion | Proven performance |

Every campaign automatically tracks all three, giving brands better accuracy and platforms predictable revenue.

## How It Works

1. User expresses intent inside an AI interface  
2. Platform sends structured context to AdMesh  
3. AdMesh decides whether to trigger a commercial response  
4. Eligible brand agents receive the context  
5. Brand agents respond in real time  
6. AdMesh selects and returns a response  
7. Platform renders it natively  
8. Exposure and engagement are tracked and billed transparently
