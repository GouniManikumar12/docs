## Welcome to AdMesh

**AdMesh** is the first **AI-native ad network** built on top of the **AdMesh Protocol**, a new infrastructure that connects AI chatbots, assistants, and search platforms with verified product recommendations in real time.

It enables platforms to **monetize user intent** and helps advertisers **reach decision-ready audiences** through conversational placements while maintaining privacy, transparency, and contextual integrity.

---

## What Is AdMesh?

AdMesh bridges the gap between **AI platforms** and **advertisers** using intent-driven recommendations instead of traditional display ads.

When a user asks something like "best payment gateways for startups" or "tools for creating pitch decks", AdMesh identifies the **intent**, retrieves **relevant offers**, and returns structured recommendations for the platform to display naturally inside its responses.

---

## Why AdMesh Exists

Traditional ad systems (CPM/CPC) weren't designed for AI.
They rely on banners, cookies, and visual inventory, not real-time conversations or language models.

AdMesh introduces a **three-tier performance model** suited for the conversational web:

| Tier | Trigger | What It Measures |
|------|----------|------------------|
| **CPX** | Verified exposure | Visibility and reach |
| **CPC** | User click | Engagement and interest |
| **CPA** | Conversion | Proven performance |

Every campaign automatically tracks all three, giving brands accuracy and platforms predictable revenue.
