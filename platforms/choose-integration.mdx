title: "Choosing Your Integration"
description: "Compare Weave Ad Format and Citation & Product Format to decide which fits your AI platform best"
---

AdMesh offers two powerful integration formats for monetizing AI conversations.
Both support **AI chatbots**, **search assistants**, and **generative LLM applications** — the difference lies in **how much control you want** over the UI and API flow.

---

## Quick Comparison

| Feature | **Weave Ad Format (API)** | **Citation & Product Format (SDK)** |
|----------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Integration Type** | API-based | SDK-based |
| **Control** | Full control of UI and placement | Automatic rendering |
| **Ideal For** | Platforms that weave sponsored responses inside AI output | Platforms that display pre-built cards or citations |
| **Rendering** | You decide how, where, and when recommendations appear | SDK auto-renders inside your app |
| **Setup Time** | Moderate (custom rendering) | Minimal (3-step SDK install) |
| **LLM Compatibility** | Perfect for agents that generate natural text | Great for assistants showing answer cards or citations |
| **Tracking** | Manual pixel firing | Automatic via SDK |
| **Transparency Label** | Add `[Ad]` subscript manually | Auto-included in SDK output |
| **Examples** | ChatGPT-style chatbots, voice agents, conversational apps | Search copilots, widgets, dashboards, browser extensions |

## How to Choose

Use **Weave Ad Format** if you:
- Want fine-grained UI and conversational control.
- Need to dynamically insert offers into AI-generated text.
- Already have an LLM integration and want programmatic flexibility.

Use **Citation & Product Format** if you:
- Want to integrate quickly with little or no code.
- Prefer AdMesh to handle rendering, labeling, and pixel tracking.
- Are building a chatbot, widget, or extension that surfaces offers or citations visually.
