# Creative Formats

AdMesh supports five creative formats for displaying recommendations. Each format is optimized for different use cases and platform types.

## Format Overview

| Format | Best For | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| **weave** | Conversational AI | Inline contextual text inserted into LLM responses |
| **tail** | Most platforms | Paragraph-level block ad shown after organic response |
| **product_card** | E-commerce, product discovery | Structured card with images, value props, and CTA |
| **bridge** | Vibe Coding Platforms, AI IDEs | Setup prompts and documentation URLs for followup recommendations |
| **followup** | AI platforms with follow-up UI | Headless format for sponsored follow-up queries (platform-native integration) |

## Format Selection

<Note>
**Automatic Format Selection**: `allowed_formats` are automatically fetched from your platform configuration (set during onboarding). You do not need to specify formats in API requests.

For **Vibe Coding Platforms**, the bridge format is automatically selected during onboarding.
</Note>

## Weave Format

**Use case**: Embedding sponsored recommendations directly into conversational AI responses.

### Schema

```json
{
  "format": "weave",
  "weave_content": "[Ad] {context_snippet} {short_description} Learn more: {url}"
}
```

### Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description | Example |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `format` | string | Yes | Must be `"weave"` | `"weave"` |
| `weave_content` | string | Yes | Short, inline, contextual text to insert into assistant response. Format: `"[Ad] {context_snippet} {short_description} Learn more: {url}"` | `"[Ad] For startups needing higher limits and automated expense workflows. CRM built for growing teams, with AI-assisted workflows. Learn more: https://admesh.click/stk_abcxyz123"` |

### Example

```json
{
  "format": "weave",
  "weave_content": "[Ad] For startups needing higher limits and automated expense workflows. CRM built for growing teams, with AI-assisted workflows. Learn more: https://admesh.click/stk_abcxyz123"
}
```

### Integration

The weave format is designed to be naturally inserted into LLM-generated responses. The `[Ad]` label ensures transparency.

---

## Tail Format

**Use case**: Displaying recommendations as a separate block after the organic response.

### Schema

```json
{
  "format": "tail",
  "tail_content": "{long_description}\n\n{cta_label}: {url}"
}
```

### Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description | Example |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `format` | string | Yes | Must be `"tail"` | `"tail"` |
| `tail_content` | string | Yes | Paragraph-level block ad to show after organic response. Format: `"{long_description}\n\n{cta_label}: {url}"` | `"Nimbus CRM Pro is designed for teams of 5-50 people who need intelligent pipeline management. It includes automated follow-ups, collaborative forecasting, and embedded AI copilots that help close deals faster.\n\nStart Free Trial: https://admesh.click/stk_abcxyz123"` |

### Example

```json
{
  "format": "tail",
  "tail_content": "Nimbus CRM Pro is designed for teams of 5-50 people who need intelligent pipeline management. It includes automated follow-ups, collaborative forecasting, and embedded AI copilots that help close deals faster.\n\nStart Free Trial: https://admesh.click/stk_abcxyz123"
}
```

### Integration

The tail format is displayed as a separate block after the main response. It's ideal for platforms that want to clearly separate organic content from sponsored recommendations.

  "offer_summary": "Special offer: 50% off first year for teams"
}
```

## Format Transformation

The operator transforms `creative_input` into format-specific creatives based on:

1. **Platform's `allowed_formats`**: Automatically fetched from platform configuration
2. **Brand agent's preferred format**: From the bid
3. **Query context**: Optimized for the user's intent

## Best Practices

### For Weave Format
- Keep `context_snippet` concise (60-100 characters)
- Make it relevant to the user's query
- Ensure natural integration into LLM responses

### For Tail Format
- Use `long_description` for detailed information
- Include clear CTA with compelling label
- Keep formatting clean with proper line breaks

### For Product Card Format
- Provide high-quality images
- Limit `value_props` to 3-5 most compelling points
- Ensure `logo_url` and `primary_image_url` are accessible

### For Bridge Format
- Provide clear, actionable setup instructions
- Link to comprehensive documentation
- Make it easy for developers to get started

### For Followup Format
- Use platform's existing follow-up suggestion UI
- Fire exposure when follow-up becomes visible
- Fire engagement before executing query
- Execute query immediately after engagement
- See [Followup Format Guide](/platforms/followup-format) for complete integration details

---

## Followup Format

**Use case**: Headless, platform-native engagement format for AI platforms with existing follow-up suggestion UI.

### Schema

```json
{
  "format": "followup",
  "followup_query": "Compare Nimbus CRM Pro vs Salesforce pricing and features"
}
```

### Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description | Example |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `format` | string | Yes | Must be `"followup"` | `"followup"` |
| `followup_query` | string | Yes | Sponsored query string to execute when user selects the follow-up (also used as display text) | `"Compare Nimbus CRM Pro vs Salesforce pricing and features"` |

### Example

```json
{
  "format": "followup",
  "followup_query": "Compare Nimbus CRM Pro vs Salesforce pricing and features"
}
```

### Integration

The followup format is **completely headless** - AdMesh provides data and tracking endpoints, but no UI components. Platforms use their existing follow-up suggestion UI to render sponsored follow-ups. See the [Followup Format Guide](/platforms/followup-format) for complete integration instructions.

**Key characteristics:**
- Headless design - no AdMesh UI components
- Platform-native integration using existing follow-up UI
- Exposure and engagement tracking via SDK utilities
- CPE billing (cost-per-engagement) capped at 50-60% of max CPC
