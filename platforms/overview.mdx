## Introduction

AdMesh enables conversational platforms (AI assistants, search engines, chat applications) to monetize through contextually relevant product recommendations. We offer flexible integration options to fit your platform's architecture and requirements.

---

## Package Requirements

### Mandatory: `admesh-ui-sdk`

**`admesh-ui-sdk` is required for all AdMesh integrations.**  
This package provides the core functionality every platform needs:

- **Session Management**: Automatically creates and manages user sessions  
- **Recommendation Fetching**: Retrieves contextually relevant recommendations from AdMesh  
- **Rendering**: Displays recommendations in your UI with proper formatting  
- **Tracking**: Automatically tracks exposures, clicks, and conversions  
- **Transparency**: Adds `[Ad]` labels to comply with advertising standards  

The SDK handles all of this automatically, so you don't need to manage these concerns yourself.

**Key Features:**
- Zero-code integration (3 simple steps)  
- Automatic session lifecycle management  
- Built-in error handling and fallbacks  
- Support for multiple ad formats (citation, product cards, etc.)  
- Configurable theming and styling  

---

### Optional: `admesh-weave-node`

**`admesh-weave-node` is an optional additional package** for developers who want to weave recommendations directly into their application's response text or content (e.g., LLM-generated responses).

Use this package if you want to:
- Integrate recommendations into LLM responses  
- Have full control over recommendation formatting  
- Build custom conversational ad experiences  
- Weave product mentions directly into generated text  

**Key Features:**
- Lightweight backend SDK for Node.js  
- Direct integration with the AdMesh Protocol  
- Database-backed caching for instant retrieval  
- Configurable polling with sensible defaults  
- Full control over recommendation formatting  

---
