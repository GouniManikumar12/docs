# Platform Overview

AdMesh lets AI platforms, chatbots, and search systems show **contextual sponsored recommendations** directly inside organic responses.
You control the UI, while AdMesh handles **ads, tracking, and attribution** behind the scenes.

---

## Integration Flow

Follow these 5 steps to integrate AdMesh recommendations into your product:

| Step | Action | Docs |
|------|---------|------|
| 1 | **Create Session** ,  Start a new conversation context | [Create Session](/platforms/create-session) |
| 2 | **Get Recommendations** ,  Fetch contextual ads for a query | [Get Recommendations](/platforms/get-recommendations) |
| 3 | **Inline Recommendations** ,  Pass AdMesh offers to your LLM | [Weave Inline Recommendations](/platforms/inline-recommendations) |
| 4 | **Fire Exposure Pixels** ,  Track impressions when showing ads | [Fire Exposure Pixel](/platforms/fire-exposure-pixel) |
| 5 | **Close Session** ,  End or expire the session cleanly | [Close Session](/platforms/close-session) |

## Example Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
participant User
participant Platform
participant AdMesh
participant LLM

User->>Platform: Asks a question
Platform->>AdMesh: POST /agent/session/new
AdMesh-->>Platform: Returns session_id
Platform->>AdMesh: POST /agent/recommend (with session_id)
AdMesh-->>Platform: Returns recommendations
Platform->>LLM: Adds Inline Recommendations block + rules
LLM-->>Platform: Returns contextual response with [Product](link)<sub>[Ad]</sub>
Platform->>User: Displays blended organic + sponsored response
Platform->>AdMesh: Fires exposure pixels
Platform->>AdMesh: (Optional) POST /agent/session/close
```

## Platform Flexibility

**You can fully design your own UI** ,  grid, carousel, chat bubble, card layout, or anything else.
There's **no required AdMesh component**.

However, you **must label AdMesh recommendations clearly** so the exposure pixels can be triggered correctly when shown.

This means:
- Clearly identify the section or cards as **"AdMesh Recommendations"** (for transparency)
- Ensure we can detect when the AdMesh recommendations are actually visible ,  this is how exposure pixels are triggered

Example label:
```html
<div class="admesh-section">
  <h4>AdMesh Recommendations</h4>
  <div id="admesh-recommendations"></div>
</div>
```
