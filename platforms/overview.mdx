# Platform Overview

AdMesh lets AI platforms, chatbots, and search systems show **contextual sponsored recommendations** directly inside organic responses.
You control the UI, while AdMesh handles **ads, tracking, and attribution** behind the scenes.

## Choose Your Integration

AdMesh offers two complete integration formats. Pick one and follow the comprehensive guide:

| Format | Type | Best For | Setup |
|--------|------|----------|-------|
| **Weave Ad Format** | API-based | Custom conversational ads, LLM integration | Moderate |

AdMesh-->>Platform: Returns session_id
Platform->>AdMesh: POST /agent/recommend (with session_id)
AdMesh-->>Platform: Returns recommendations
Platform->>LLM: Adds Weave Recommendations block + rules
LLM-->>Platform: Returns contextual response with [Product](link)<sub>[Ad]</sub>
Platform->>User: Displays blended organic + sponsored response
Platform->>AdMesh: Fires exposure pixels
Platform->>AdMesh: (Optional) POST /agent/session/close
```

### Citation & Product Format Flow

## Platform Flexibility

**You can fully design your own UI** ,  grid, carousel, chat bubble, card layout, or anything else.
There's **no required AdMesh component**.

However, you **must label AdMesh recommendations clearly** so the exposure pixels can be triggered correctly when shown.

This means:
- Clearly identify the section or cards as **"AdMesh Recommendations"** (for transparency)
- Ensure we can detect when the AdMesh recommendations are actually visible ,  this is how exposure pixels are triggered
