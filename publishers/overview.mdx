## Introduction

AdMesh helps publishers add contextual monetization directly inside content experiences.

Instead of static display placements, you can surface intent-aware product suggestions using:

- `AdMeshProvider` for SDK setup, session context, and tracking
- `AdMeshIntentAssistant` for a floating assistant that suggests relevant sponsored options

---

## Why Publishers Use AdMesh

- **Intent-aware monetization**: Suggestions are aligned to what users are reading and asking
- **Low integration effort**: Add one provider and one component
- **Native UX**: Assistant fits inside your site instead of sending users away to ads-first layouts
- **Transparent tracking**: Exposure and engagement tracking is handled by the SDK

---

## How It Works

1. Wrap your page or app with `AdMeshProvider`
2. Pass your API key and a session ID
3. Render `AdMeshIntentAssistant` on article/content pages
4. Assistant surfaces relevant suggestions based on page context
5. Sponsored interactions are tracked automatically

---

## Recommended Integration Pattern

Use this on long-form pages such as:

- Publisher articles
- Product guides
- Review/comparison pages
- Editorial and affiliate content
